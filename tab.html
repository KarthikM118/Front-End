          <p>Black holes are formed from the remnants of massive stars that have ended their life cycles. When a star with a mass greater than approximately 20 times that of the Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it may undergo a supernova explosion, collapsing under its own gravity into a singularity—a point of infinite density—and creating a black hole.</p>

          <p>The boundary surrounding a black hole is known as the event horizon. This is the point beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The event horizon marks the limit of our observational ability, as any information about events occurring inside this boundary cannot reach an outside observer.</p>

          <p>There are primarily three types of black holes: stellar black holes (formed from collapsing stars), supermassive black holes (found at the centers of galaxies, with masses ranging from millions to billions of solar masses), and intermediate black holes (with masses between stellar and supermassive black holes, believed to form through the merging of smaller black holes).</p>

          <p>Proposed by physicist Stephen Hawking, Hawking radiation is theoretical radiation that is emitted by black holes due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This radiation implies that black holes can lose mass and energy over time, potentially leading to their eventual evaporation.</p>

          <p>Black holes have a profound impact on the fabric of space-time. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the immense gravity of a black hole warps space-time around it, creating extreme gravitational effects. This can lead to phenomena such as gravitational lensing, where light from objects behind the black hole is bent, and time dilation, where time appears to slow down near the event horizon compared to an observer at a distance.</p>
